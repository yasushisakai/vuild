# next version of shopbot

current shopbot is limited in the following reason.

- extensible
  control box is blackbox, especially hard for syncing movement with other sensors
- distributed
  machines are isolated
- opensourced
  learning material for both using and hacking are lacking.

develop not as a machine tool, but as a construction robot.

JETSON T2 dev kit
[http://www.nvidia.com/object/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules.html](http://www.nvidia.com/object/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules.html)

by using a robot+AI platform, easy to apply novel research in the field of robotics.
this will include image recoginition, locallization, deep learning... etc.
